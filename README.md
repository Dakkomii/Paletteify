## Key Features

**The most challenging features implemented

- Search By Color - We implemented different techniques-- for instance, when you click one of the 10 color aesthetic buttons under the search bar, we are utilizing a RGB Color Classifier idea, whereas when you click a palette circle under a post image, we are using our own color distance formula.
- Palette Design - Layout, especially for the palettes, was difficult-- dealing with PureCSS grids.
- Favorites Feature - One specific issue we ran into with the favoriting feature was that the page would reload each time a heart was pressed.

## Testing Notes

- There are no notes for testing.
